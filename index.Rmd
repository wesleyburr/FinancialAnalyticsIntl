## Reproducibility 

Today, I am specifically interested in discussing reproducible research *methods*, particularly with 
respect to data gathering, manipulation, and analysis.

## Reproducible Research Methods

First published work I am aware of that discusses the specific framework I am
thinking of (computational reproducibility) is 1990-92, J. Claerbout 
at Stanford:

<br/>

J. Claerbout, M. Karrenbach, *Electronic documents give reproducible research a new meaning*, in Proceedings of the 62nd Annual International Meeting of the Society of Exploration Geophysics, New Orleans, USA, 25 to 29 October 1992.

## Reproducible Research Methods

Some quotes:

<br/>
- a revolution in education and technology transfer follows from the marriage of word processing and software command scripts

--

- researchers ... can reproduce their own research results a year or more later by "pressing a single button"

--

- Our basic goal is reproducible research. The electronic document is our means to this end

<br/>
https://doi.org/10.1190/1.1822162

## Definition

<br/>
... the idea that scientific results should be documented in such a way that their deduction is fully transparent. This requires a detailed description of the methods used to obtain the data and making the full dataset and the code to calculate the results easily accessible.
**This is the essential part of open science.**

<br/>

## Some Necessary Components

To make any research project computationally reproducible

- all data and files clearly: separated; labelled; documented
    
--

- all operations should be automated as much as practicable, avoiding manual intervention 

--

- workflow designed as a sequence of steps (**scripts!**), combined so intermediate outputs from one step directly feed in as inputs to the next

--

- version control should be used

---

## Workflow Includes

- data acquisition

--

- data processing
    - entry
    - manipulation
    - filtering

--

- data analysis
    - computation of statistics
    - figures
    - model-fitting (including interim steps!) 
    - linear flow, resist urge to modify earlier steps

## Tips for Getting Started in Small Ways

- force yourself to organize your class materials in a coherent manner (downloaded lectures, assignments, notes)

--

- save all of your software work (scripts, examples, rough work for assignments)

--

- always be learning - tons of resources

File organization and naming
are powerful weapons against chaos.

## Basic Principles

Basic principles

Step 1: slow down and document.<br/>
Step 2: have sympathy for your future self.<br/>
Step 3: have a system.<br/>

## Context and Motivation

When doing lab work, you:

- use notebooks to

--

    - organize methods
    - organize and record results
    - jot down conclusions

--

- convert these notebooks into Methods sections for lab reports or scientific papers

---

class: inverse

## Context and Motivation

When working computationally, you *should* do the same thing!

- data provenance

--

- detailed log of workflow

--

- tools used at each step

--

- parameters ("researcher degrees of freedom") recorded

--

- versioning for software

---

## The Computational Notebook (with Markdown!)

Now, for both R and Python, **notebooks** exist. These are computational
representations of the traditional lab notebook, freely mixing:

## The Computational Notebook (with Markdown!)

Now, for both R and Python, **notebooks** exist. These are computational
representations of the traditional lab notebook, freely mixing:

- text

--

- code (replaces math)

--

- figures (replaces diagrams)

--

- analysis

--

- results

Additionally, when run as a document instead of an interactive notebook,
the framework is set up to **force** reproducibility through
the action of **knitting**.

## Advantages

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
m <- mean(x)
m
```

The code and results are right there!

---



## Advantages

```{r}
plot(x = x, y = y)
```

Figures and graphs are right there, with their code!

---



## Advantages

```{r}
mod <- lm(y ~ x, data = data.frame(x, y))
plot(x = x, y = y)
abline(mod, col = "red")
```

Run models, syntax is immediate, researcher decisions are clear.

---

class: inverse

## Advantages

- forces you to think about workflow

--

- integrates all decisions into one place

--

- teaches coding skills by "stealth" (osmosis: template, scaffold, expose)

--

- is actually how most researchers work: no baby software or apps

--

- infinitely extensible

--

- supported by the R ecosystem and CRAN

## Musings

- Bias: I'm a statistician, and work with (and write) software every day of my professional life

--

- However ...
    - software is [eating the world!](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/)
    - we **owe** it to ourselves to adapt to this system
    - even if it's uncomfortable for us, and we're not "computer people", this doesn't cut it!
    - the **current** best practices will not be the same in 5, 10, 20 years - you have to be prepared for lifelong learning
